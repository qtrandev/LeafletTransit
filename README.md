# LeafletTransit 

## What

This is a LeafletJS-based prototype of a real time map for various transit systems, including Miami-Dade Transit and various trolley services.

Live demo is at http://qtrandev.github.io/LeafletTransit. Past demo is at http://www.qtrandev.com/transit

Reload the site often for the latest data to show. (Can use Shift + Reload button for full page refresh)  
Press F12 in your browser to view the Javascript console for any errors.

The following data are shown
* Live buses
* Routes of the live buses and their official route color
* Bus stops of the routes
* Citi bikes
* Points of interest

Depends on https://github.com/CyberStrike/miami-transit-api to retrieve data from http://www.miamidade.gov/transit. During night-time when no bus data is returned, no buses are shown.  
See http://miami-transit-api.herokuapp.com for API documentation.

## Why
